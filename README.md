# FSE2024-1567

 In this repository, we have provided the data for the FSE submission #1567: “Investigating Deep Learning Model Changes and the Impact of Modularity”

We have divided the package into three folders (one for each research question):

1. Taxonomy Generation:
The results for this RQ are in folder Repositories. In this folder, we present the source code for mining Github repositories with the relevant criteria. The file README.md inside this folder contains information information about all the files in it.

2. User Study:
We provide the questions used to conduct the study. We also provide examples of responses received and our analysis of the responses. Moreover, we provide the Stack Overflow question and links as given in the table. All these are present in folder User Study.

3. Benchmarking Existing Decomposition Styles:
We present the results in folder Experimental Evaluation. It contains the results for all experiments and the design structure matrix for the changes. Moreover, we share the source code and our models and datasets in an external link available in README.md inside the folder.
